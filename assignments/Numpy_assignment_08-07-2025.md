1.  **Create a 5x5 NumPy array filled with random integers between 1 and 20.**

2.  **From the array you just created, extract:**
    *   The element in the third row, second column.
    *   The first three rows.
    *   All columns from the second column onwards.
    *   All elements that are greater than 15.

3.  **Calculate the mean of each row and the sum of each column** of your 5x5 random array.
